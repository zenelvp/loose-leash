    question: "Will this work for my specific breed or size of dog?",
    answer:
      "This program is designed specifically for medium to large dogs (30-100+ pounds). It works for Golden Retrievers, Labs, German Shepherds, Pit Bulls, mixed breeds, and any dog strong enough to pull you around. The threshold mapping and leash mechanics adjust to your dog's specific triggers and strength level.",
  },
  {
    question: "My dog is extremely reactive will gentle methods really work?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Reactivity actually gets worse with harsh corrections because stress makes dogs more explosive. The reactivity safe passing protocols teach you to work below your dog's threshold where they can actually learn. You'll map their triggers and create safe distances that prevent lunges before they happen.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much time do I need each day?",
    answer:
      "Just 10-15 minutes daily. The micro session protocol works with your dog's natural attention span. Most people see progress within the first week because short, focused sessions create faster learning than hour long training marathons.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What if I've already spent hundreds on gear and classes that didn't work?",
    answer:
      "Most solutions fail because they don't teach proper timing, leash mechanics, or threshold management. This program shows you how to use basic gear effectively through precise hand positioning, reward timing, and pattern games. You don't need expensive equipment you need the right skills.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is this really humane? My dog seems to need firm corrections.",
    answer:
      "The science is clear reward based methods create better obedience with fewer problem behaviors. When dogs pull, they're not being defiant. They're excited and haven't learned proper walking skills. This method teaches them what you want instead of punishing what you don't want.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if my dog doesn't improve in 30 days?",
    answer:
      "The program includes weekly assessments and a graduation test with clear criteria. If you follow the daily sessions and your dog doesn't pass the final test, you get your money back. The troubleshooting playbook addresses plateaus and setbacks.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use this if my dog is already older or set in their ways?",
    answer:
      "Age doesn't matter for learning new habits. The step-by-step progressions work for puppies through senior dogs. Older dogs often learn faster because they have better focus than young, excitable pups.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I encounter situations not covered in the program?",
    answer:
      "The ARC decision framework (Assess React Control) gives you a real time system for any trigger. Plus the Quick Reference Guide provides instant answers for dogs, people, bikes, strollers, and unexpected situations.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need special equipment or just a regular leash?",
    answer:
      "The Gear Setup Checklist covers everything you need. Most people already have suitable equipment. The program teaches you proper leash mechanics that work with any standard 6 foot leash and well fitted harness.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if my dog regresses after 30 days?",
    answer:
      "The maintenance section and proofing protocols prevent backsliding. You'll have the skills to handle setbacks and continue improving. Most regression happens when people skip the gradual progressions the program prevents this.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can this help with other behavioral issues besides pulling?",
    answer:
      "The threshold mapping and engagement techniques often improve general reactivity, jumping, and attention issues. While the focus is leash walking, the underlying skills create better communication in all situations.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there ongoing support if I get stuck?",
    answer:
      "The troubleshooting playbook addresses the most common challenges. The criteria checklists and weekly assessments help you identify exactly where to adjust your approach when progress stalls.",
  },
