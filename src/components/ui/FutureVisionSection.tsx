              It's a beautiful morning. You grab the leash and your dog calmly
              sits while you clip it on.
            </p>

            <p className="font-semibold text-gray-900">
              No wrestling. No drama.
            </p>

            <p>
              You step outside and your dog walks beside you. The leash stays
              loose. Your shoulders feel relaxed.
            </p>

            <p>
              A neighbor walks by with their dog. Your dog glances over but
              keeps walking calmly. No lunging. No embarrassment.
            </p>

                "Wow, your dog is so well-behaved," the neighbor says with
                genuine admiration.

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">

              When you master these proven techniques, every walk becomes
              something you actually look forward to.
            </p>

            <p>
              Your spouse will volunteer to walk the dog. Your kids will beg to
              come along. Neighbors will ask for your training advice.

            Last Concerns Addressed
          </h2>

          <p className="text-white">
            I know you might still have some doubts. That's completely normal
            after trying so many things that didn't work.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white">
            Let me address the concerns I hear most often...
          </p>

          <h3 className="font-semibold mt-4 text-[#00D378]">
            "What if my dog is just too strong or stubborn for gentle methods?"
          </h3>
          <p className="text-white">
            I understand this worry. You've been overpowered by your dog so many
            times.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white">
            But here's the truth: strength has nothing to do with training
            success. Even 200-pound police dogs walk calmly using these same
            principles.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white">
            Your dog isn't being stubborn. They're just unclear about what you
            want. The threshold mapping and micro-session protocols work with
            any size dog because they address the real problem communication,
            not muscle power.
          </p>

          <h3 className="font-semibold mt-4 text-[#00D378]">
            "What if I don't have time for lengthy training sessions?"
          </h3>
          <p className="text-white">
            This concern makes perfect sense. You're already overwhelmed.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white">
            That's exactly why this program uses 10-15 minute micro-sessions. No
            hour long training marathons. No weekend bootcamps.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white">
            Just short, focused daily practice that fits into your morning
            routine. Most people find these brief sessions easier to stick with
            than their current exhausting walks.
          </p>

          <h3 className="font-semibold mt-4 text-[#00D378]">
            "What if this doesn't work for my specific dog?"
          </h3>
          <p className="text-white">
            I get it. You've been disappointed before. Your dog feels uniquely
            difficult.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white">
            But the trigger mapping system adapts to any dog's specific issues.
            Reactive dogs, strong pullers, anxious dogs the protocols adjust to
            your situation.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white">
            Plus, you're protected by the money back guarantee. If you don't see
            clear progress in 30 days, you get every penny back.
          </p>

          <h3 className="font-semibold mt-4 text-[#00D378]">
            "What if I'm just not good at training?"
          </h3>
          <p className="text-white">
            This fear runs deep. You've tried before and felt like a failure.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white">
            But you're not the problem. You were never taught proper leash
            mechanics or timing. Most training advice is confusing and
            contradictory.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white">
            This program gives you exact hand positions, footwork, and decision
            trees. You'll know exactly what to do in every situation. No
            guesswork.
          </p>

          <h3 className="font-semibold mt-4 text-[#00D378]">
            "What if it's too expensive after everything I've already spent?"
          </h3>
          <p className="text-white">
            I completely understand this concern. You've already invested in
            harnesses, classes, and trainers without lasting results.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white">
            But think about the cost of doing nothing. More shoulder pain. More
            embarrassment. More expensive gear that doesn't work.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white">
            This program costs less than two private training sessions but gives
            you a complete system you'll use forever.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white">
            The real question isn't whether you can afford this program. It's
            whether you can afford another year of stressful, painful walks.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white">
            Your dog is waiting for you to take action. The solution is right
            here.
