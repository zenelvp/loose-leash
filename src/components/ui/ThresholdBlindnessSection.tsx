        The Real Problem Threshold Blindness

        Here&apos;s what nobody tells you about leash pulling
      </p>

      <p className="text-xl text-gray-800 font-semibold mb-6">
        Your dog isn&apos;t being stubborn or trying to dominate you.
      </p>

        They&apos;re stuck in what I call{" "}
        <span className="font-bold text-gray-900">Threshold Blindness </span>
        the hidden trigger zone where your dog&apos;s stress levels spike and
        their brain shuts down to learning.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        Every time you walk past another dog, person, or even an interesting
        smell, your dog crosses into this invisible stress zone. Once they&apos;re
        there, they can&apos;t think clearly. They just react.

          Pull. Lunge. Drag you forward.

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        And here&apos;s the worst part
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        Most training advice actually makes Threshold Blindness worse. When you
        yank the leash or use harsh corrections, you&apos;re adding more stress to an
        already overwhelmed dog.
      </p>

      <p className="text-xl text-gray-800 font-semibold mb-6 italic">
        It&apos;s like trying to teach someone math while they&apos;re having a panic
        attack.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        No wonder nothing has worked so far.

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          This isn&apos;t your fault. You were never taught how to see these
          invisible stress zones or how to keep your dog calm and focused during
          walks.

          But once you understand Threshold Blindness, everything changes.
